# dinder

dinder is a mobile solution to those nights that you’re out and just can’t figure out what to eat. You search Google for “places to eat near me” and stare blankly at the list of too many options. didner allows you to specify your food preferences, travel distance, and the amount you’re willing to spend.  Based on your interests, didner will generate individual profiles for each place that fulfills your interests and displays them to you one by one so you are no longer overwhelmed. Not likin’ what you’re seeing? Swipe left. See a place that’s lookin’ good? Swipe right. After swiping right, dinder will load an extended profile of the location including a local map so you can see exactly where you’re going to be eating. Next time you can’t figure out what to eat, use dinder!
